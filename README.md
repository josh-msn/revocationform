# revocationform

The interested party receives an individual link containing the property ID and the interested party ID from the database. The cancellation form is then displayed. If the form is accepted, the interested party is redirected to the expose. The data of the property and the interested party are retrieved from the database and the accepted form is saved. 

If the link is called up again and the interested party has already accepted, they are forwarded directly to the property.


URL Example: 

https://yoururl.com/?iid23&imid1 

In this example the interested party has the ID 23 and the property the ID 1
